<h3>Bulk download over http, ftp and rsync</h3>

<p>
  If you would like to download bigger amounts of Paituli data, using the
  traditional download as .zip file might be quite limiting. To overcome that we
  have now added the option of downloading data over HTTP, FTP and rsync from
  nic.funet.fi service. In the data folder of each dataset is a Readme-file,
  that includes the basic infomation and link to Etsin, where full dataset
  descriptions are available.
</p>

<p>The root paths for each protocal are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>HTTP</strong>:
    <a href="http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/geodata/" target="_blank"
      >http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/geodata/</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>FTP</strong>:
    <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/sci/geo/geodata/" target="_blank"
      >ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/sci/geo/geodata/</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>rsync</strong>: rsync://rsync.nic.funet.fi/ftp/pub/sci/geo/geodata/
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended software</h3>

<p>
  FTP and rsync are both good options for downloading folders with subfolders,
  as it is easy to just select the highest level folder and download all of its
  contents.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The easiest way for using an FTP service is to download an suitable
    graphical tool, for example
    <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla </a>or
    <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Of command line tools we recommend <strong>rsync</strong>. It has the
    ability to continue a download, if it has frozen for some reason and can
    preserve the original modification date. rsync should be included in most
    Linux distributions by default. In Windows you have to add it manually, for
    example <a href="https://itefix.net/cwrsync">cwRsync</a>.
  </li>
  <li>If rsync is not suitable, try <strong>wget</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding the data</h3>

<p>
  Paituli includes in total 12 Tb (= 12 000 Gb) of data, so in most cases it
  should be enough to download only some parts of it.
</p>

<p><strong>If you want to download the whole dataset</strong></p>

<p>
  You can browse the the directories in HTTP or FTP mode, the datasets have been
  stored in quite logical structure, so you might find what you are looking for.
  In the tree you have to first select the data producer, then dataset and then
  year (and other options). The folders have mostly names in Finnish.
</p>

<p>
  The other option is to find the dataset spesific paths from Download data
  page:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href="download.html">Download data</a> page,</li>
  <li>Select the dataset you are interested</li>
  <li>Open the "Links" tab in lower left corner.</li>
  <li>
    Navigate to the mentioned folder with some FTP tool OR use rsync for
    downloading the data:
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="codeBlock">rsync -a rsync://rsync.nic.funet.fi/ftp/pub/sci/geo/geodata/<bstyle="color: blue;">mml/hallintorajat_milj_tk/2017/folder_to_save/</b>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Change the blue parts in the command as needed.</li>
  <li>
    -a use archive mode, inc. save the original dates and download reqursively
    also all subfolders
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong
    >If you want to download only spesific mapsheets of some dataset</strong
  >
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href="download.html">Download data</a> page.</li>
  <li>Select the dataset you are interested</li>
  <li>
    Select the mapsheets you need from the map or find them with the search.
  </li>
  <li>Click on the "Download list of files" button on the left side.</li>
  <li>
    You will receive the link to file list to your e-mail, download that
    file.<br />
    (Alternatively you can make a custom file using the paths given in index
    map, which is available for each dataset in
    <a href="download.html">Download data</a> page Links tab.)
  </li>
  <li>Use rsync for downloading the data:</li>
</ol>

<div class="codeBlock">rsync -a --files-from=<b style="color: blue;">file_list.txt</b> rsync://rsync.nic.funet.fi/ftp/pub/sci/geo <b style="color: blue;">folder_to_save/</b>
</div>

<h3>Using wget for download</h3>

<p>
  In some places ftp and rsync are forbidden at firewall level, then you can use
  wget with http. wget has a lot of different options, one well working
  combination is this:
</p>

<div class="codeBlock">wget -r -l inf -N -np -nH -x -E -R html --cut-dirs=http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/geodata/<b style="color: blue;">mml/hallintorajat_milj_tk/2017/</b>
</div>

<div>-r, recursive download</div>

<div>
  -l inf, how deep the requirsive search goes, default is 5, here set to
  infinite
</div>

<div>
  -N, update only, do not download already existing files, this is important if
  download was interrupted or updating already existing data.
</div>

<div>-np, do not download parent directories</div>

<div>-nH, remove hostname</div>

<div>-x, make directories similarly to Paituli</div>

<div>
  -cuts-dirs, cut certain number of directories from the beginning to avoid too
  deep directory trees
</div>

<div>
  -E, makes html files to be named like .html, otherwise files without any
  extention are created (not needed when using ftp)
</div>

<div>-R html, do not save html files (not needed when using ftp)</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use the ftp protocol if possible, otherwise you might get some extra
      index.* files.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you want to file list, add the -i option with the name of files list
      file. Add also the root path to each row. The root paths are given in the
      beginning of this page.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Mounting FTP as local drive</h3>

<p>
  It is possible to mount an FTP site as local drive. This would enable opening
  the files directly from any GIS software without any extra manual steps for
  downloading. Of course the files actually have to be downloaded before using
  them, so opening a file from FTP is slower than actual local file.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Linux users can use for example
    <a href="http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net/">curlFtpFS</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    For Windows there does not seem to be any such free software that would work
    with reasonable speed.
  </li>
</ul>
