<h1>Share your spatial data with Paituli</h1>
<p>
	Students and personnel of Finnish universities have possibility to
	share their own spatial data with Paituli. It could be data that has been
	gathered for a scientific study or a course project. This data could be about
	Finland or any other region in the world. 
</p>
<p>
	After publishing anybody can download your data. Datasets suitable for
	<a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/" target="_blank">GeoServer</a> can also be
	previewed on download page and they will be available also as standard OGC web
	services (WMS, WCS, WMTS or WFS). </p>
<p>
	Annually CSC generates a report about Paituli
	usage, including number of downloads for each dataset. This report will be
	sent to all data providers. Each dataset in Paituli has a permanent identifier in URN format. 
</p>
<p>
	CSC publishes data free of charge and will not get any rights for the data.

			<li>
				Coordinate system: ETRS-TM35FIN (EPSG:3067) for data about Finland,
				WGS-84 (EPGS:4326) for global data.
			</li>
			<li>Maximum file size 2 Gb.</li>
			<li>
				Divide data to map sheets if needed, if you have map sheet index as a

		file in
		<a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/styling/sld-cookbook/" target="_blank">SLD</a>

		<strong>Send the data and its description to <a href="mailto:giscoord@csc.fi" rel="nofollow">giscoord@csc.fi</a></strong>. Smaller datasets may be sent as attachments, for bigger files
			<a href="https://filesender.funet.fi/" target="_blank">FUNET FileSender</a> is better.
