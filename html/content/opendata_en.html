<h1>Open your spatial data</h1>

<p>
  Students and personnel of Finnish universities have possibility to
  publish&nbsp;their own spatial data in Paituli. It could be data that has been
  gathered for a scientific study or a course project. This data could be about
  Finland or any other region in the world. For publishing your data please
  follow the steps below.
</p>

<p>
  After publishing anybody can download your data. Datasets suitable for
  <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/">GeoServer </a>can also be
  previewed on download page and they will be available also as standard OGC web
  services (WMS, WMTS or WFS). Annually CSC generates a report about Paituli
  usage, including number of downloads for each dataset. This report will be
  sent to all data providers.
</p>

<p>
  CSC publishes data free of charge and will not get any rights for the data.

          >Etsin research data finder service</a
        >. There is no special field for accuracy (scale) and coordinate system,
        please write these to the "Free description" field on front page. Please
        fill in also Format and Temporal coverage fields on tab "4. Additional
        information". If you have more detailed metadata as a file or webpage,
        also these can be linked to Etsin.</span

    <strong>Package your data</strong>&nbsp;for download, technical
    recommendations
    <ul>
      <br />
      <li>
        Format: Compressed Geotiff or JPG2000 for raster, Shape or PostGIS dump
        for vector data, LAZ for laser scanning data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coordinate system: ETRS-TM35FIN (EPSG:3067) for data about Finland,
        WGS-84 (EPGS:4326) for global data.
      </li>
      <li>Maximum file size 2 Gb.</li>
      <li>
        Divide data to map sheets if needed, if you have map sheet index as a
        separate file, include that to data package
      </li>
      <li>Make a .zip file of all the files.</li>
      <li>
        These are only recommendations, if you feel some other option would suit

    Optional. If you want to use a specific&nbsp;<strong>style</strong>&nbsp;for
    visualizing your data in WMS and WMTS services, make a style description
    file in
    <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/styling/sld-cookbook/"
      >SLD</a
    >
    format and add it to the data package. If you are not familiar with SLD,
    also styles suitable for ArcGIS or QGIS may be submitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write&nbsp;<strong>metadata</strong>&nbsp;about your data to
    <a href="https://etsin.avointiede.fi/">Etsin</a>. For spatial datasets
